              content={`
                <p>Microplastics are small plastic particles less than 5mm in diameter that are increasingly found throughout our environment. They come from a variety of sources, including the breakdown of larger plastic items, microbeads in personal care products, and synthetic fibers from clothing.</p>
                
                <p>As plastic production has increased exponentially since the 1950s, so too has the amount of plastic waste in our environment. This waste breaks down into smaller and smaller particles, eventually forming microplastics and even nanoplastics (particles smaller than 1Î¼m).</p>
                
                <p>Research into the health effects of microplastics is still emerging, but evidence suggests that these particles can enter the human body through ingestion, inhalation, and even skin contact. Once inside the body, they may cause a range of health problems, from inflammation and oxidative stress to disruption of the gut microbiome and endocrine system.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">Microplastics enter our digestive system primarily through the consumption of contaminated food and water. Studies have found microplastics in a wide range of food products, including seafood, salt, and even bottled water.</p>
