We are all aware of the global effects of plastic pollution on our landscapes and on the world's oceans.

And by now most of us have seen media reports on microplastics in the human body.

What most of us are unaware of is that the presence of microplastics in all living systems, including throughout our own bodies, now constitutes a threat of epidemic proportions. Its pervasiveness challenges the wellness goals across the lifespan and healthspan: from an optimal time in the womb, for the first thousand days of life right through to long and healthy aging; goals for a healthy immune system, endocrine system and cognitive ability till the end of life. And the cherished hope of a healthy and functioning brain into our advanced years.

In early 2025, those of us in the Mental Wellness Initiative of the Global Wellness Institute included microplastics awareness for brain health as one of the leading global trends in mental health and wellness.

In researching that trend, we didn't have to look far or dig too deep to find an abundance of evidence that microplastic presence in our brains and organs and even in reproductive systems and in foetal growth now constitute a substantial threat to the human species and its ability to flourish and thrive.  

We came to realise that all of the efforts of the multi-trillion dollar Global Wellness Economy are happening against a silent and unrecognized assailant on our biological functioning and capacity to thrive. And this led to the realization that it is both timely and important to share the current knowledge about microplastics with the global wellness community. 

Why?
•	Because recognition, prevention and removal of toxins have always been at the heart of pathways to wellness. 
•	Because without recognizing this silent pervasive opponent to our efforts, we will be sleepwalking in a self-deluding and consumer-deluding journey of believed optimization when our efforts are being progressively and pervasively undermined by an external threat. 

_Microplastics are the elephant in the wellness room._ Whether or not we choose to do anything about this species-wide threat is our individual and corporate choice. But this is a choice that should be based on being fully informed rather than by sailing along in ignorance. 

In this White Paper we have waded through mountains of information and evidence, assisted in this by AI, and have focused in on those dimensions that are of importance to wellness lifestyles, wellness practitioners and educators, and to the global wellness industry.

One thing that we have learned is that there is a fire hose of information on this topic cascading out every week. And this means that by the time you are reading this White Paper, there will be an as-yet uncollated further body of information that will progressively refine the lens on how this manufactured problem is impacting our natural capacity to flourish and thrive. 

Accordingly, we will now publish weekly updates on progress in knowledge action and policy on microplastics and human health and wellbeing at: www.microplasticpulse.com

We also invite everyone to learn about this topic and to incorporate it into your professional and organizational policy and practice and new strategies to help prevent and reduce the impact of microplastics on the environment and human health. 

Surely the global wellness community should be at the forefront of thinking and innovative action to ensure that our leadership role in creating and sharing pathways for humans thriving is relevant, generative and impactful well into the future.
